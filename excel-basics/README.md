# Description
This workshops was created for the 2021 Mid-Atlantic Neuroscience Diversity Scholars (MiNDS) orientation.

The topics that will be covered include importing data, quality control, data wrangling, and data visualization. 

# Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is that Microsoft Excel should be available on your computer. Google Sheets may work, but has not been tested. 

# To-do Before Workshop
Download the two CSV files from this repository. These will be used as a playground dataset for the workshop.
