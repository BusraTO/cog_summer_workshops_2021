## Description
This workshop introduces attendees to the basics of git and GitHub and why it is a useful tool for researchers. This course is largely based on materials from [Elizabeth DuPre](https://emdupre.github.io/git-course/) and [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

## Prerequisites
1. Basic experience with the unix shell or terminal and navigating file structures (using commands like `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`)
    - This [software carpentry workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) is particularly useful for familiarizing yourself with the unix shell. This workshop requires attendees to be comfortable with lessons 1, 2, and 3.

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Be able to access your terminal/unix shell (instructions [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html))
2. Install git on your local computer ([mac/linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) [pc](https://neurodatasci-course-2020.netlify.app/setup/))
3. Make a GitHub account (sign up [here](https://github.com/))
- *note*: be sure to use the email address you plan to list with git

## Workshop objectives:
1. Introduce basic git and GitHub concepts for version control
2. Demonstrate collaborating using GitHub

## Workshop Materials
- [Notebook Viewer]()
- [Intro Slides]()

## Additional Resources
There are SO MANY amazing resources for learning and troubleshooting git/github. Here are a few that I use often:

### Learning
- [Software Carpetry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- Elizabeth DuPre's [Git Course](https://emdupre.github.io/git-course/)
- Stephanie DeCross's [Visual Guide to GitHub](https://zenodo.org/record/3369466#.YL4cVDZKh24)
- Mozilla's [GitHub training](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/introducing-github-for-collaborative-work-and-version-control/)
- Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)
- [GitHub's Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/set-up-git)

### Troubleshooting
- [dangit, git!?!](https://dangitgit.com/)
- literally copy and pasting error messages into google and seeing what comes up on stack exchange

### Desktop Clients & GUIs
If you're still more comfortable working with a GUI or desktop client, these are two that are quite popular. git and GitHub also have integrations with many IDEs such as Atom and VSCode.

- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
