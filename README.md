# COG Summer Workshops 2021
The Coding Outreach Group (COG) weekly summer workshops focus on a specific research skill or topic and aim to have participants actively involved. These workshops try to be as hands-on as possible and for attendees to get the most out of the workshops, they should ideally already have some basic coding experience (i.e., be able to run an analysis in at least one coding language). People new to coding are welcome to attend but may not receive the adequate help needed to follow along with the content. If you would like to learn some basic coding, we have a [list of tutorials](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/Tutorials/blob/master/index.md) for various programming languages.

## Agenda
Workshops are on Thursdays in June and July from 12pm to 1pm

## Getting Started
Each workshop will list the necessary pre-requesites in their respective README.md files, but here is some software we recommend you install before the workshops<sup>*</sup>:
- A command-line shell (i.e. Bash)
- A text editor you're comfortable with (Atom, VSCode, etc.)
